# Chat Feature Setup Guide

## Prerequisites

The chat feature uses Stream Chat for real-time messaging. To enable it, you'll need to:

1. **Get Stream Chat API Keys**
   - Go to [getstream.io](https://getstream.io) and sign up for a free account
   - Create a new app in your dashboard
   - Copy your API Key and Secret

2. **Configure Backend Environment**
   Create a `.env` file in the `backend` folder with:
   ```env
   STREAM_API_KEY=your-stream-api-key
   STREAM_API_SECRET=your-stream-api-secret
   ```

3. **Configure Frontend Environment**
   Create a `.env` file in the `frontend` folder with:
   ```env
   VITE_STREAM_API_KEY=your-stream-api-key
   ```
